# Bug Bounty Program for the Mokens Contract

This bug bounty program applies to the [Mokens contract](Mokens.sol) in this repository.

I am willing to pay up to 1 ETH total for security vulnerabilities or other bugs found or for important gas optimizations. The amount of ETH paid for a bug found will depend on the severity and importance of the bug and the helpfullness of the bug report. No ETH will be paid for bugs that have been previously reported.

To report a bug create an issue in this repository about it.

Generally, any useful comments, about bugs or not, are appreciated.

The bug bounty starts now and ends on 30 May 2018 or potentially later than that.
